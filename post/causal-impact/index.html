Then change the data to a matrix format as a condition for analysis with the CausalImpact packages.\npre \rNow we have the data ready to verify the causal effect of the campaign.\nimpact \rBy default, the plot contains three panels. The original first panel shows counter-factual data and predictions for the post campaign period. The second panel pointwise shows the difference between the actual observed (leads) and the predicted data. The third cumulative panel describes the cumulative effects of the intervention (campaign) conducted.\nThese results assume that the relationship between leads generation and the observed time series, as determined during the pre-period, remains stable throughout the post-period. We can view the statistical information by using the command summary(impact)\nsummary(impact)\r# Posterior inference {CausalImpact}\r# # Average Cumulative # Actual 1417 18424 # Prediction (s.d.) 984 (55) 12786 (711) # 95% CI [871, 1088] [11329, 14141]\r# # Absolute effect (s.d.) 434 (55) 5638 (711) # 95% CI [329, 546] [4283, 7095] # # Relative effect (s.d.) 44% (5.6%) 44% (5.6%) # 95% CI [33%, 55%] [33%, 55%] # # Posterior tail-area probability p: 0.00103\r# Posterior prob. of a causal effect: 99.89669%\r# # For more details, type: summary(impact, \"report\")\rWe can get information from the actual and predicted effect (average) and their absolute and relative effects. The output of statistical information above says, leads generation after the campaign has increased by 44%, from the estimated average website visitors of 984 people to 1417 in reality.\nFor guidance on correct interpretation of summary table results, the CausalImpact packages provide its interpretation text, which we can print using the command:\ninterpretation \r# Analysis report {CausalImpact}\r# # # During the post-intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approx. 1.42K. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average response of 0.98K. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [0.87K, 1.09K]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is 0.43K with a 95% interval of [0.33K, 0.55K]. For a discussion of the significance of this effect, see below.\r# # Summing up the individual data points during the post-intervention period (which can only sometimes be meaningfully interpreted), the response variable had an overall value of 18.42K. By contrast, had the intervention not taken place, we would have expected a sum of 12.79K. The 95% interval of this prediction is [11.33K, 14.14K].\r# # The above results are given in terms of absolute numbers. In relative terms, the response variable showed an increase of +44%. The 95% interval of this percentage is [+33%, +55%].\r# # This means that the positive effect observed during the intervention period is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random fluctuations. It should be noted, however, that the question of whether this increase also bears substantive significance can only be answered by comparing the absolute effect (0.43K) to the original goal of the underlying intervention.\r# # The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is very small (Bayesian one-sided tail-area probability p = 0.001). This means the causal effect can be considered statistically significant.\r\r",

<p>Leads generation is highest on Wednesday. This information can be taken into consideration in determining the day to start the campaign.</p>
<p>Next we will be subset 37 days before the campaign and saved to the <code>pre_campaign</code> object. So we can see the movement of leads and think about the increase that has been generated since the campaign was initiated.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pre_campaign &lt;- actual %&gt;% 
  slice(1:37)</code></pre>
<p>Next, create time series objects and do modeling to make a banchmark of leads that we can get if we don’t use campaigns. We will use Holtwinter as a method to forecast the next 16 days.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ts_campaign &lt;- ts(pre_campaign$unique_views, frequency = 7)

<p>To estimate the causal effect, we begin by determining which period in the data should be used to train the model (the pre-intervention period) and which period to calculate the <strong>counterfactual</strong> prediction (the post-intervention period).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pre &lt;- c(1,37)
post &lt;- c(38, 53)</code></pre>
<p>The code above means that the 1st to 37th observation points will be used for training, and the 38th to 53th observation points to calculate predictions, or we can also define them in the date interval format. Then change the data to a matrix format as a condition for analysis with the <code>CausalImpact</code> packages.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pre &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2018-05-16&quot;, &quot;2018-06-24&quot;))
post &lt;- as.Date(c(&quot;2018-06-25&quot;, &quot;2018-07-10&quot;))

time.points &lt;- seq.Date(as.Date(&quot;2018-05-16&quot;), by = &quot;days&quot;, length.out = 53)
data_ci &lt;- zoo(
  cbind(actual$unique_views, append_data$unique_views), 
  time.points
)</code></pre>
<p>Now we have the data ready to verify the causal effect of the campaign.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>impact &lt;- CausalImpact(data = data_ci, pre.period = pre, post.period = post)
plot(impact)</code></pre>
<p><img src="http://ahmadhusain.in/post/causal-impact/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>By default, the plot contains three panels. The <code>original</code> first panel shows <em>counter-factual</em> data and predictions for the post campaign period. The second panel <code>pointwise</code> shows the difference between the actual observed (leads) and the predicted data. The third <code>cumulative</code> panel describes the cumulative effects of the intervention (campaign) conducted.</p>
<p>These results assume that the relationship between leads generation and the observed time series, as determined during the pre-period, remains stable throughout the post-period. We can view the statistical information by using the command <code>summary(impact)</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(impact)</code></pre>

<p>We can get information from the actual and predicted effect (average) and their absolute and relative effects. The output of statistical information above says, leads generation after the campaign has increased by 44%, from the estimated average website visitors of 984 people to 1417 in reality.</p>
<p>For guidance on correct interpretation of summary table results, the CausalImpact packages provide its interpretation text, which we can print using the command:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>interpretation &lt;- summary(impact, &quot;report&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>#&gt; Analysis report {CausalImpact}
#&gt; 
#&gt; 
#&gt; During the post-intervention period, the response variable had an average value of approx. 1.42K. By contrast, in the absence of an intervention, we would have expected an average response of 0.98K. The 95% interval of this counterfactual prediction is [0.87K, 1.09K]. Subtracting this prediction from the observed response yields an estimate of the causal effect the intervention had on the response variable. This effect is 0.43K with a 95% interval of [0.33K, 0.55K]. For a discussion of the significance of this effect, see below.
#&gt; 
#&gt; Summing up the individual data points during the post-intervention period (which can only sometimes be meaningfully interpreted), the response variable had an overall value of 18.42K. By contrast, had the intervention not taken place, we would have expected a sum of 12.79K. The 95% interval of this prediction is [11.33K, 14.14K].
#&gt; 
#&gt; The above results are given in terms of absolute numbers. In relative terms, the response variable showed an increase of +44%. The 95% interval of this percentage is [+33%, +55%].
#&gt; 
#&gt; This means that the positive effect observed during the intervention period is statistically significant and unlikely to be due to random fluctuations. It should be noted, however, that the question of whether this increase also bears substantive significance can only be answered by comparing the absolute effect (0.43K) to the original goal of the underlying intervention.
#&gt; 
#&gt; The probability of obtaining this effect by chance is very small (Bayesian one-sided tail-area probability p = 0.001). This means the causal effect can be considered statistically significant.</code></pre>
